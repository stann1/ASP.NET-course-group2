# ASP.NET-course-group2

Repository for the ASP.NET course demos. All projects/demos we do in class will be posted here - in separate folders for each lesson.

Hint for those unfamiliar with Git - just download the whole repository as a zip file, but you have to keep manual track of when it changes, so that you can re-download
